# plugin-Solvator# plugin-Solvator

1. Place the whole plugin-Solvator folder in the PluginLib directory of Olex2, located in util/pyUtil/. The folder containing all Solvator files should be called plugin-Solvator. 

2. In the main contents folder of Olex2, you may already have a file called plugins.xld. If not, create one.

The plugins.xld file should be a plain text file and look like this: (although you may have other plugins present in additon to Solvator): 

<br><Plugin
<br> <Solvator\>
<br>\>
